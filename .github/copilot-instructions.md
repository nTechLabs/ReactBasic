This is a React Vite project using JSX (not TypeScript). The project includes:

## Libraries and Tools
- **React 19.1.0** - Using JSX syntax

- **Ant Design** - UI component library
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing

## Project Guidelines
- Use JSX syntax (not TypeScript)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement React Query for API calls and server state
- Use Zustand for global client state management
- Use Ant Design components for UI instead of custom CSS or HTML elements
- Use React Router DOM for client-side routing and navigation
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Use ES6+ features and modern JavaScript syntax

## Code Style
- Use arrow functions for components
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use destructuring for props and state
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibilities
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic

## Ant Design Guidelines
- Import specific components from 'antd' (e.g., Button, Card, Layout)
- Import icons from '@ant-design/icons'
- Use Ant Design's Layout, Space, and Grid system for layouts
- Leverage Ant Design's built-in styling and theming
- Use Ant Design's form components and validation
